        A PolyMeasure (or measure) represents a SQL "group by one view, evaluate over another" statement, with options
        for supplying the usual SQL operators or modifying the evaluation in other programmatic ways.
        The class provides a framework for creating analysis expressions over SQL database systems, in particular the
        duckdb SQL engine.

        PolyMeasures have three main components

        - an inner view, also a PolyMeasure
        - a set of outer PolyMeasures to evaluate over that view, and
        - a set of dimensions to group the inner view by when evaluating the outer view(s).

        The function evaluate returns a SQL statement, which will be syntactically valid only subject to
        sensible construction of the "PolyMeasure Tree".
        This evaluation may occur inside the evaluation contexts of other PolyMeasures, so that SQL expressions are
        built up recursively to achieve some complex calculation.

        In the following notation we drop the name parameter and write

        `M( Outer * Dim; Inner: Where, Context )`

        when describing a PolyMeasure, in line with the order of the other parameters of importance.
        The context can be parameters like having or order by clauses.
        The where parameter specifies additional filters to apply to the

        There are two classes of PolyMeasures - those with a free view, where Outer = None, or a bound view
        which already exists in the database.
        A bound measure with the usual arguments will be denoted `B( Inner * Dim; Outer: Where )`
        and a free measure denoted `F( Inner * Dim; Outer: Where )`. Free views become handy expressions like
        "count(*) of any inner table" or "count(*) over dimensions of the inner table".

        Free measures take on the context of the inner query in a PolyMeasure, rather than referencing a basic
        view in the schema. This allows a single PolyMeasure object to perform a double aggregation over a given
        view, where we group once, then group the resulting rowset again and perform some aggregation.

        If a free measure is supplied to the outer measure list, it will query the corresponding inner measure list.
        Free measures cannot be supplied as the inner measure of a PolyMeasure.

        Bound measures should have a default string value for the view, appropriate to the schema.
        Using the supplied factory method BoundedMeasure will return a super-classed PolyMeasure
        keyed to any views required.

        In the following examples, we assume one unique bounded measure exists,
        B = B(dim=Rowset(), inner=main_view), which acts as the ultimate "leaf" measure.
        The class Free is also provided, which defaults the measure view to Free instead, and is aliased F.

        The Outer and Inner arguments are PolyMeasure vectors, which each can return tables of any dimension.
        When different dimensions are supplied in the outer measures, self.dim is used to group the inner view,
        but each measure still evaluates by matching only on its own dimension, if specified.
        No attempt is made to reconcile the dimensions between inner and outer arguments - if a measure requests
        a column that doesn't exist in dim(M) (the inner dimension specified by M), then the SQL parser
        will let you know :)

        When supplied as an argument, a tuple is interpreted as a "Dummy PolyMeasure" (name, inner, [dim]),
        where dim can be omitted. These measures are always free.

        When defining dimensions, [] means group by the whole table,
        RowSet means do not group the view. None is a wildcard, which means the measure will default
        to the dimensions of the enclosing measure after dimension promotion.

        The view and where parameters are applied to the inner query, Inner * Dim.
        For example if you want to apply a filter context to Outer directly (which is the final output aggregation),
        use M( Inner * Dim; F(Outer: Where_Outer): View, Where)

        Here are the things you can build with a single PolyMeasure

        1) M( Outer ) - Outer measure with no specified dimension - will take on the dimension of the enclosing measure.
        2) M( * Dim ) - A summary table of the dimensions Dim.
        3) M( Outer * Dim ) - A summary table of the dimensions with Outer measures calculated over each group.
        4) M( ; Inner ) - Defaults to M( Inner )
        5) M( Outer * Dim ; Inner ) - A set of aggregated calculations (Outer) grouped by Dim over Inner.

        ==========================================

        Invalid measures fail on evaluation, not instantiation. Test with where 0 = 1 to validate.....

        ==========================================

        Bound measures are "inner idempotent", meaning passing them as the sole argument to an inner parameter
        of a PolyMeasure constructor creates an object with the same evaluate() properties.

        Free measures don't have this property.
        The free context of F is overwritten by the context of the nearest enclosing bound measure B.

        In summary:
    ```
          B( B( Outer * Dim; Inner: Where) )
        = F( B( Outer * Dim; Inner: Where) )
        = B( F( Outer * Dim; Inner: Where) )
        =    B( Outer * Dim; Inner: Where)
    ```
        all hold. (Note: Inner=None implicitly in the expression F( Outer * Dim; Inner: Where))

        ==========================================

        In pseudo-sql M( Inner * Dim; Outer; Where, Context ) evaluates as:

        with __VIEW__ as ( [select [Inner] from view([Inner])] )

        select [(
            select [Outer] from (view(Outer) OR __VIEW__) dynamic_view
            where dynamic_view.dim(Outer) = __VIEW__.dim(Outer)
        )], Dim

        from __VIEW__
        where Where
        group by Dim
        <<context>>

        There is a simpler presentation when Dim = Rowset(G):

        with __VIEW__ as ( [select [Inner] from view([Inner])] )

        select [Outer], __VIEW__.G

        from __VIEW__
        where Where
        <<context>>

        ==========================================

        Every outer measure needs to have dimensions that match the inner
        query. Use aliases or the rename function to achieve this.
